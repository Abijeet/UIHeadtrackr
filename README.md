Headtrackr 
============

This is an app that me and my teammates made for the Yahoo Hackathlon in 2013, Hyderabad, India.

It's a simple app, that takes control of your camera, and allows you to slide through images with your head. 

Yes! Just tilt your head in the direction that you want the images to go.

Currently only works with Chrome. 


Feel free to fork it, and play around with it.

Cheers!
